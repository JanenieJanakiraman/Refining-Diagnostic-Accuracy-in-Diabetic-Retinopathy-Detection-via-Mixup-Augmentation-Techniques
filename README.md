# Refining-Diagnostic-Accuracy-in-Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-via-Mixup-Augmentation-Techniques
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) can lead to blindness if not detected early. We explored DenseNet architectures (121, 169, 201) for DR diagnosis and used Mixup data augmentation to handle class imbalance. The quadratic weighted kappa metric was applied for evaluation, resulting in DenseNet201 achieving 98.39% accuracy, improving overall performance.
