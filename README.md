# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using DenseNet

## Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model to detect Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) at an early stage, which is crucial in preventing vision loss. DR is a condition that progresses from Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR) to Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) and can be detected through fundus images.

## Objective
- Train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using DenseNet architectures (DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201) for DR classification.
- Enhance model generalization and performance by implementing data augmentation (Mixup) and employing advanced evaluation metrics (quadratic weighted kappa).

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Standardized image processing and normalization.
2. **Model Architecture**: Implemented DenseNet architectures for feature extraction and classification.
3. **Data Augmentation**: Used Mixup to generate synthetic training samples and address class imbalance.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Applied the quadratic weighted kappa for a more refined performance measure.

## Results
- **DenseNet201** achieved the highest accuracy of **98.39%**.
- Improved classification performance with the combination of Mixup and quadratic weighted kappa.

## Installation & Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then use the following to set up the environment:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the training script to train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```

For model evaluation:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```
